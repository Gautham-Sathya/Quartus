Nios2 folder has a picture of some instantiated softcore processors and their qsys files. 
HDL has some practice work  from VHDL and verilog. Each file was tested with a tb but the tb isn't mine to use in most cases.
Pipemult was the initial multiplier project I did. There's a picture of the bdf in the folder as well as the files needed to run it.
